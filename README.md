# Kidney-and-Kidney-Tumor-Segmentation-on-3D-CT-Scan-using-DeepLabV3-
This repository contains the project "Kidney and Tumor Segmentation Using AI and Deep Learning." It leverages the KiTS23 dataset to develop models that accurately segment kidneys and tumors from 3D CT scans. Our work aims to improve medical imaging analysis, aiding early detection and treatment planning for kidney cancer.
