# Kidney-and-Kidney-Tumor-Segmentation-on-3D-CT-Scan-using-DeepLabV3-
This repository contains the project "Kidney and Tumor Segmentation Using AI and Deep Learning." It leverages the KiTS23 dataset to develop models that accurately segment kidneys and tumors from 3D CT scans. Our work aims to improve medical imaging analysis, aiding early detection and treatment planning for kidney cancer.

## Overview

This project aims to segment kidneys and kidney tumors from 3D CT scans using advanced AI and deep learning techniques. Our approach utilizes the KiTS23 dataset to develop and evaluate models that enhance the accuracy and efficiency of medical imaging analysis.

## Features

- **Dataset**: KiTS23 (Kidney Tumor Segmentation Challenge 2023)
- **Algorithms**: State-of-the-art deep learning models
- **Tools**: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, and other relevant libraries
- **Results**: Detailed analysis and performance metrics of the models
- **Applications**: Early detection and treatment planning for kidney cancer
